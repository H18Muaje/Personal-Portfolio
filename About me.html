                Our life has been difficult. I was very stressed because my family broke up last year. This problem caused me to neglect my academics,
                 and even now, that's why I joined ROTC. It's not just to fulfill my dream of being a soldier, but also to help me cope with my problems.
                I have a brother and a sister; they are very naughty. My father is old and he was a farmer, but now his family side take his farming land,
                 even they have a money. Every year they plant corn and wheat, but they experience losses because their farming skills are poor.</pre>
