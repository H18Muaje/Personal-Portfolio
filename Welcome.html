    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <pre>
My name is Justine, and I'm an 18-year-old college student pursuing a BSIT degree with the dream of becoming a game developer
and programmer. Life has been challenging for me, especially after my family broke up last year, which led to significant stress 
and neglect of my academics. To cope with these difficulties and fulfill my aspiration of serving my country, I joined the ROTC.

I come from a family with a brother and a sister who can be quite mischievous. My father, who is older and was once a farmer,
has faced struggles as his family has taken over his farming land despite having the means. Each year, they plant corn and wheat, 
but due to their limited farming skills, they often experience losses.</pre>

    <pre> 
Iâ€™ve made mistakes in the past, including bullying my friends, but I regret those actions and am committed to improving my behavior
and building better relationships. Thankfully, my friends have always been incredibly supportive, providing comfort and assistance
whenever I face challenges. They are a constant source of strength for me, and I consider them my chosen family.
 
In my free time, I enjoy playing online games with my friends, which serves as a much-needed escape from academic
pressures and responsibilities. We also bond over shared meals, which are more than just sustenance; they are opportunities
to connect, laugh, and strengthen our friendships. Although I acknowledge that I am a slow learner, I dedicate countless hours
to studying and practicing to master the skills necessary for my future career.</pre>
