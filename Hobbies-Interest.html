I'm a boring person, and sometimes I even bullied my friends. This is something I regret, and I'm working on improving my behavior and building better
relationships. My friends have always been incredibly supportive, offering comfort and assistance whenever I've faced challenges. They're a constant
source of strength for me. My dream is to become a game developer and programmer, which is why I choose to pursue a BSIT degree. It's a challenging,
and I'll readily admit that I'm a slow learner. However, I'm dedicated to mastering the skills required, and I consistently strive to improve my 
understanding and abilities. 
   
I spend countless hours studying and practicing, and I'm determined to achieve my goals. Playing online games with my friends is a cherished hobby 
and a escape from the stress. These online sessions provide a much-needed escape from the pressures of academic life and other responsibilities. 
Beyond gaming, my friends and I share another strong bond, we eat together. These meals are more than just sustenance; they're opportunities for us 
to connect, laugh, and strengthen our friendships. We're incredibly close, and I consider them to be my chosen family.</pre>
